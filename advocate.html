			Advocacy means supporting and promoting a cause you believe in.
			At Habitat for Humanity, we advocate to change policies and systems in the United States and internationally
			to eliminate barriers to adequate and affordable housing.Building is part of the solution. But that’s not
			enough. In addition to lifting our hammers, we have the ability – and, now more than ever, the responsibility 
			– to promote sustainable and inclusive policy solutions, ensuring everyone has access to adequate and affordable
			housing.
        </p>
        
        <h1>United States</h1>
        <p>
		In the United States, Habitat works collectively to influence and change policies and systems at all levels of 
		government to ensure that more families can find affordable, quality homes across the U.S.
        </p>
        
        <h1>International</h1>
        <p>
            Internationally, Habitat works to address essential housing needs in more than 70 countries by engaging
			with local and regional governments, civil society organizations, and global policymaking bodies to promote
			policies that expand access to adequate, affordable housing and ensure communities are at the center of housing
